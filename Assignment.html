		<h3>Why are Bernese Mountain Dogs the best?</h3>
		<p>Bernese Mountain dogs are beautiful and kind dogs. What else could you ask for?</p>
		
		<p> This is a quote from <a href="https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/bernese-mountain-dog/">American Kennel Club</a> </p>
		<blockquote cite="http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds-bernese-mountain-dog/">
		Big, powerful, and built for hard work, the Bernese Mountain Dog is also strikingly beautiful and blessed with a sweet, affectionate nature. Berners are generally placid but are always up for a romp with the owner, whom they live to please.
